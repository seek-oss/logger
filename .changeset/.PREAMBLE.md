⚠️ **Important:** If you are opting into the eeeoh logging configuration that uses the `DD_ENV` environment variable, be aware that this may have unintended effects on your application-level metrics.

The `DD_ENV` variable is a global Datadog setting that automatically tags all metrics sent from your application. This impacts any package using [hot-shots] for metrics collection, including SEEK packages like [koala], [seek-datadog-custom-metrics] and [skuba].

Potential consequences:

- Existing metrics dashboards may show different data groupings
- Monitors and alerts might trigger unexpectedly or stop working
- Historical metric comparisons could be disrupted
- Metrics may appear in different environments than intended

It is recommended to:

1. Carefully review your metrics dashboards and monitors after enabling eeeoh in a non-production environment
1. Update dashboards and monitors to reflect the new environment tags

For more information about eeeoh configuration, see the [documentation](https://github.com/seek-oss/logger/blob/master/docs/eeeoh.md).
